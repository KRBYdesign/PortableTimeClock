        Hopefully you won't need to reference this page too often. I've worked
        very hard to make this system robust and fault tolerant. Below, you'll
        find everything you need to know when it comes to running this whole
        server / database / website clock-in nonsense.

      <h1>Server / Raspberry Pi</h1>
      <p>
        This is kinda technical so I'll go ahead and apologize in advance.
        Hopefully I've explained the process well enough that everything goes
        smoothly, and with minimal confusion.
      </p>
      <h2>Setup:</h2>
      <ol id="pi-setup-list">
        <li>Router must be plugged in and turned on.</li>
        <li>
          <div class="li-with-image">
            <p>
              Using an ethernet cable, connect the Pi to the router through one
              of the "Fast Ethernet" jacks located on the back of the router. It
              doesn't matter which port you choose, as long as it's not the blue
              one.
            </p>
            <img
              src="./help/RouterConnectionDiagram.png"
              style="width: 400px"
            />
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure the USB dongle for the keyboard and mouse is connected to a USB
          port on the Pi.
        </li>
        <li>Ensure the Pi is connected to a monitor via HDMI.</li>
        <li>
          Plug in the Raspberry Pi via the micro USB power cable, and flip the
          switch to the "On" position. The fan just inside the top of the Pi's
          case will turn on, indicating the pi is receiving power. It may be
          difficult to see, but a red and green LED should be on / flashing on
          the edge of the pi's motherboard.
        </li>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Note: </strong>You shouldn't need to login to the Pi. It
          should be automatic. However if you do, the username is "kyle" and the
          password is "214itpi".
        </p>
        <br />
        <li>Connect the clock in / scanning laptops to the network:</li>
        <p><strong>Network:</strong> TNT-Lan 2.4</p>
        <p><strong>Password:</strong> locallogin</p>

      <br />
      <h2>Turning On the Server:</h2>
      <p>
        This is going to make use of the Pi's terminal. Be sure to follow all
        instructions carefully. Spelling, punctuation, and capitalization are
        all very important when navigating the terminal.
      </p>
      <ol id="server-setup-list">
        <li>
          In the Pi's taskbar (located at the top of your screen) there is an
          application named "Terminal". Open that.

              You are looking for the "eth0: inet" address. That is the Network
              IP address for the Pi. Write that number down, you may need it
              later.<br /><br />
              It will be in a format similar to 192.168.__.____

      <h1>Database</h1>
      <p>
        The database lives on the Pi along with the server, using MariaDB. More
        than likely the MariaDB service started along with the rest of the Pi
        and you wont have to do anything to make the database work. However if
        you need to start the service for whatever reason, in a new terminal

      <h1>Front End (Website)</h1>
      <p>
        The "front-end" is where you are now. Its the whole of the website.
        Below you can find instructions and explanations to how the different
        parts of the website function.
      </p>
      <h2>Clock In / Out Page</h2>
      <p>
        The time-clock page takes a scanned barcode and makes an "In" or and
        "Out" request for the provided user. The appropriate action is
        calculated by the server itself. Once the appropriate action is
        completed, the page will update to display a "Time Card" of sorts,
        showing the user's name, the action taken, and the time said action was
        taken.
      </p>
      <ol id="front-end-setup-list">
        <li>Ensure the "Scan Barcode" input fields is selected.</li>
        <li>Scan the user's barcode.</li>
        <li>Click "Submit"</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Register / Lookup Page</h2>
      <h3>Look Up By Name</h3>
      <p>
        The registration page possesses the ability to lookup any user's barcode
        by name should they lose their card and need it to be reprinted. In the
        event multiple guards exists matching given search name, all matching
        users will appear in a list with their ID number next to their names, as
        well as a print button to print their cards if needed.
      </p>
      <h3>Register</h3>
      <p>
        The page can also create new users in the User Database and generate an
        ID number / card for them.
        <strong>Do not create ID's for users who already exists.</strong> Look
        them up and reprint their card. The page will attempt to prevent the
        creation of duplicate guards but will not be able to save you in all
        cases.

      <img src="./when-server-down-iceeramen.gif" id="shaq-meme" />
      <p>
        In the event that the webpages aren't working as intended, visit the
        "Register" page. Look up a user who you know for certain exists. Should
        nothing return, there are a couple of reasons to why that'd be:

          <strong class="code">IP</strong> ensure the value is the same as the
