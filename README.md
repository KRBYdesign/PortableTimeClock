Simple api-based employee time clock system. This project utilizes ExpressJS and MariaDB running on a Raspberry Pi for the back-end, and supports multiple front-ends running on other computers' localhosts. In this example, XAMPP is used by the client computers.  

In theory this project could be extended to function using a live domain, however a constraint on this project was the lack of internet access.

In this instance, communications are handled by a cheap wireless router.

The front end features a "Help" page which helps an end user to use the setup and run the entire time clock system.

## What's included?

- All front end code (sans the .gif used on the help pages, and the logo in the header.)
- All back end code
- User List and Time Clock management tools utilizing python

Aside from [Barcode.js](https://github.com/lindell/JsBarcode), and the Node Modules, all code featured in this project is written by myself.

I want to give a shout out to Robert Evans, host of the podcast [Behind the Bastards](https://google.com), for putting out the 5-part banger, "G. Gordon Liddy, the Fascist Behind Watergate". Your tongue and cheek humor got me through the process of learning asynchronous functions.
